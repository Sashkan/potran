        I try to maintain a healthy balance between work and play. I love
        playing video games, watching movies, and reading books. I also enjoy
        working out and going on hikes.

        I firmly believe in the power of habits, and ownership. After a few
        rough years, I decided to take control of my life and make it better.
        This blog is a mix of all the teachings I found along the way.
