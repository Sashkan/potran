# Making it obvious

Bad habits are behaviors that can be hard to break, especially if we are not fully aware of them. Often, we engage in bad habits without even realizing it, and this can make it challenging to change our behavior. However, making a bad habit more obvious can help us recognize it and take steps to overcome it.

Here are some tips on how to make a bad habit more obvious:

**Keep a journal or log**: Writing down your daily routine and activities can help you identify patterns and habits that you might not be aware of. Make a note of everything you do throughout the day, including the time of day, your mood, and any triggers that might be contributing to your bad habit.

**Use a habit tracker**: Habit trackers are tools that allow you to record and track your progress as you try to break a bad habit. You can use a habit tracker app or a physical journal to track your habit and monitor your progress over time.

**Set reminders**: If your bad habit is something that you tend to do without thinking, setting reminders can help you become more aware of it. You can set an alarm on your phone, or use sticky notes to remind you to be mindful of your behavior.

**Seek feedback from others**: Sometimes, we are not aware of our bad habits because they have become so ingrained in our behavior. Asking friends or family members for feedback can help you identify habits that you might not have noticed on your own.

**Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness is the practice of being present and aware in the moment. When you engage in your bad habit, take a moment to pause and observe your behavior. Ask yourself why you are doing it, and try to identify any triggers or patterns that might be contributing to your behavior.

In conclusion, making a bad habit more obvious can be a helpful first step in breaking the habit. By using tools like habit trackers, setting reminders, seeking feedback from others, and practicing mindfulness, you can become more aware of your behavior and take steps to change it. Remember, breaking a bad habit takes time and effort, so be patient and kind to yourself as you work towards your goal.
