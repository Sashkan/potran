## Establish a budget

The first step to proper financial tracking is to establish a budget. A budget helps you track your income and expenses and enables you to plan your finances. Start by tracking your monthly expenses and compare them to your monthly income. This will help you identify areas where you can cut back and increase savings. A healthy rule is to divide your income into 3 pieces: savings, spending, and debt repayment.

## Use financial tracking tools

The good news is that there are numerous financial tracking tools available today that can help you keep track of your finances. These tools range from simple spreadsheets to mobile applications that allow you to track your spending on the go. Some popular financial tracking tools include Mint, Quicken, and Personal Capital. Choose the one that suits your needs and helps you stay organized. I personally use [Bankin](https://bankin.com/) to keep track of my expanses and setup my goals.

## Monitor your accounts regularly

To keep track of your finances, it's essential to monitor your accounts regularly. Make it a habit to review your bank and credit card statements at least once a week to ensure that all transactions are accurate. This also helps you identify any fraudulent activities and resolve them promptly.

## Categorize your expenses

Categorizing your expenses is an effective way to track your spending. Group your expenses into categories such as housing, transportation, groceries, entertainment, and others. This helps you identify which areas you are spending the most and where you can cut back.

## Set financial goals

Setting financial goals can help you stay motivated and focused on your finances. Establish short-term and long-term goals such as saving for a down payment on a home or paying off credit card debt. Tracking your progress towards these goals can help you stay on track and achieve financial success.

In conclusion, setting up proper financial tracking is critical to achieving your financial goals. Establish a budget, use financial tracking tools, monitor your accounts regularly, categorize your expenses, and set financial goals. With these tips, you'll be on your way to financial success. Remember, it's never too late to start tracking your finances, and the sooner you start, the better off you'll be.
