## Miracle day

As seen in [this post](/blog/habits), it only takes about 2 weeks to create a habit.

But how can you make sure that the habit you are creating is actually a healthy one ? How can you make sure that, on the long run, this habit will benefit you ?

Well, here are my two cents on the question. This article is a summary of a few books, articles and videos from which I tried to create a morning routine that, indeed, made me happier and healthier than before.

## Morning routine

- First thing I do in the morning is make my bed (if I'm sleeping alone, of course. If not, simply remove the other person from your bed, then make your bed. It's a win-win situation). It might sound silly, but this helps you start the day with a sense of accomplishment. See it as some kind of small victory.
- Then, drink half a liter of water. I used to start off the day with a cup of coffee right off the bed, but since we lose a lot of water during our sleep, it's important to rehydrate ourselves as soon as possible.
- Next, I hit the gym. Monday to Friday, from 7AM to 8.15AM. I bring a protein shake, a towel, and my workout journal, to keep track of my progress. I usually do about an hour of weight training, and 30 minutes of cardio. I also do a few stretches before and after my workout. I tried listning to podscasts during the workout, but this simply wouldn't work. Instead, I listen to [the Doom OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQmIBHObtCs). I suspect Mick Gordon to have sold his soul to the Devil in order to create this masterpiece.
- As soon as I come back home, I take a cold shower. I'll admit, this was the harshest part of the routine, but after a couple months, you'll notice the reward: **great hairs, better skin, and a lot of energy**. I also use this time to think about my day, and to plan my next steps.
- Last but not least, I take care of my skin for a few minutes, moisturize, and put some sunscreen on. This might sound like a routine out of American Psycho, but unfortunately, the air pollution in Paris is pretty bad, and it's important to protect yourself from the sun.
- Last but not least, the 5-minutes steps. Every task I have at hand, that takes roughly 5 minutes, **I do right away**. This can be anything from replying to an email, to cleaning the dishes, to doing the laundry. This way, you don't have to worry about it later, and you can focus on the more important tasks.

## Evening routine

The rest of the day it up to me,I simply try to remember water every now and then until roughly around 9PM. This is when the evening routine comes in.

- Around 9.30, I plan ahead for the next day. I usually know what I have to do for the day after, so I simply plan it as some kind of to-do list. Prepare your bag, your clothes (for both the day and the workout).
- I stop watching screens one hour before bed, and switch to books. After reading, I write a summary of everything I read. This is a good training for your memory.
- I go to bed around 10.30PM. I never had much trouble sleeping, so I usually get my 8 hours.
