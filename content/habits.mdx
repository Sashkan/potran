# You are your habits

## How to build good habits and break bad ones.

## Introduction

When I was 17, I developed a severe addiction to video games. I could spend 10 to 14 hours a day playing whatever I could. From Call of Duty to World of Warcraft, didn't matter, as long as I was the hero. As long as I could get the sweet taste of victory.

It wasn't long before this unhealthy habit turned into a downward spiral. I lost friends, I failed classes, I was a disapointment.

Six years later, I got into IT school, and for the first time of my life, I developed a somehow healthy habit: I started going to school, every single day, from 9AM to 10PM. **Every. Single. Day.** Monday to Sunday. For almost 500 days. I had a pertner in crime, and we were waiting for easch other at the entrance of the building. At 9AM exactly, we went it, even if the other one wasn't there. It was our challenge.

Of course, at that time, I didn't see that as an habit. In fact, I didn't see anything. I was too busy focusing on learning how to code, chugging half a dozen redbull cans a day. But it was, in fact, a habit.

Habits are the **building blocks** of human behavior. They are the routines we follow every day, the behaviors we repeat, and eventually, we are our habits.

## What is a habit ?

Let's put it this way: **every task that you repeat at a certain frequency is a habit**. Going for a run every Sunday morning is a habit. Brushing your teeth twice a day is a habit. Going to bed at 10PM every night is a habit.

## How to create a good habit, or break a bad one

Any habit is a mix of **four key elements**. To create any good habit, you simply have to focus on bringing these elements into your life. On the other hand, if you want to get rid of a bad habit, focus on getting these pieces out of your life.

### Evidence

The first thing to do is to point out the habit.

This can be done very easily. In the evening, take a piece of paper, and write down everything you've done today. Now, get rid of the "one shots", anything that you don't repeat on a daily basis. Once you've found the recurring patterns, try to find recurring patterns in your weeks, and in your months. This can be anything, from getting a haircut to taking out the garbage.

Now, Take anotherp iece of paper, and draw a line in the middle. On the left side, write down what you consider to be a good, healthy habit. On the other side, write down your bad habits.

Last but not least, now's the time for change. Keep up with the good habits, you don't want to lose any of them. We're going t focus on bringing more good habits to your life, and getting rid of the bad ones.

Take a last piece of paper, and write down three simple sentences to bring the evidence **Evidence** into the light.

These sentences must follow the same pattern.

```
Every [frenquency], at [time], I will/won't [action]
```

E.G, for me, it would probably look a bit like this:

- Every morning, at 7AM, I will hit the gym
- Every Tuesday and Thursday, at 6PM, I will practice the guitar
- Every night, before going to sleep, I will put my phone away in the living room.

It might sound silly, but the first step to notice a habit is to simply say it out loud.
