When I was 17, I developed a severe addiction to video games. I could spend 10 to 14 hours a day playing whatever I could. From Call of Duty to World of Warcraft, didn't matter, as long as I was the hero. As long as I could get the sweet taste of victory.

It wasn't long before this unhealthy habit turned into a downward spiral. I lost friends, I failed classes, I was a disapointment.

Six years later, I got into IT school, and for the first time of my life, I developed a somehow healthy habit: I started going to school, every single day, from 9AM to 10PM. **Every. Single. Day.** Monday to Sunday. For almost 500 days. I had a pertner in crime, and we were waiting for easch other at the entrance of the building. At 9AM exactly, we went it, even if the other one wasn't there. It was our challenge.

Of course, at that time, I didn't see that as an habit. In fact, I didn't see anything. I was too busy focusing on learning how to code, chugging half a dozen redbull cans a day. But it was, in fact, a habit.

Habits are the **building blocks** of human behavior. They are the routines we follow every day, the behaviors we repeat, and eventually, we are our habits.

## What is a habit ?

Let's put it this way: **every task that you repeat at a certain frequency is a habit**. Going for a run every Sunday morning is a habit. Brushing your teeth twice a day is a habit. Going to bed at 10PM every night is a habit.

## How to create a good habit, or break a bad one

Any habit is a mix of **four key elements**. To create any good habit, you simply have to focus on bringing these elements into your life. On the other hand, if you want to get rid of a bad habit, focus on getting these pieces out of your life.

### Make it obvious

The first thing to do is to point out the habit.

This can be done very easily. In the evening, take a piece of paper, and write down everything you've done today. Now, get rid of the "one shots", anything that you don't repeat on a daily basis. Once you've found the recurring patterns, try to find recurring patterns in your weeks, and in your months. This can be anything, from getting a haircut to taking out the garbage.

Now, Take anotherp iece of paper, and draw a line in the middle. On the left side, write down what you consider to be a good, healthy habit. On the other side, write down your bad habits.

Last but not least, now's the time for change. Keep up with the good habits, you don't want to lose any of them. We're going t focus on bringing more good habits to your life, and getting rid of the bad ones.

Take a last piece of paper, and write down three simple sentences to bring the evidence **Evidence** into the light.

These sentences must follow the same pattern.

```
Every [frenquency], at [time], I will/won't [action]
```

E.G, for me, it would probably look a bit like this:

- Every morning, at 7AM, I will hit the gym
- Every Tuesday and Thursday, at 6PM, I will practice the guitar
- Every night, before going to sleep, I will put my phone away in the living room.

It might sound silly, but the first step to notice a habit is to simply say it out loud.

### Make it attractive

It doesn't matter how obvious your habit is, if it doesn't bring you any kind of satisfaction, you won't be able to keep it up.

The key here is to find the **reward**. What is the reason you want to keep up with this habit ? What is the reason you want to get rid of this habit ? What is the reason you want to start this habit ?

To setup these rules, you have two options. You can either **reward yourself** for keeping up with your habit, or you can **punish yourself** for not keeping up with your habit. For example, if your goal is to get in shape, you can go with an easy rule: **every time I go to the gym, I'll grab a cookie**. Or, if you want to get rid of a bad habit, you can go with a more painful rule: **every time I'll eat a cookie, I'll have to do 10 push ups**.

After a few weeks, you'll notice that you don't need to punish/reward yourself anymore. You'll be able to keep up with your habit without any kind of external motivation. The attractivity is merely a trigger to get you started.

### Make it easy/hard

Every year, around the 4/5th of January, I see new people at my gym. And they go HARD. But I know that, for most of them, they won't be back next week. Because when you go that hard, that early, without any kind of practice, you're going to feel sorry the day after. Plus, you won't see any results, because anything worthy takes time to achieve.

You don't have to go all in as soon as you start working on your habits. In fact, you should start with something almost comically easy.

Here are three key concepts to make it easier to keep up with your newly formed habits:

- Make it small. Remember what we talked about earlier when pointing out our habits ? Simply update these with these magical words: _for two minutes_. This is the first step to make it way easier: _Every day, at 8AM, I will meditate for 2 minutes_. Understand that it doesn't matter for how long you practice, as long as you practice regularly.
- Make it your only focus. When you go out to see a movie, you don't bring a book. You turn of your phone. You make sure that your attention is dedicated to the movie, and nothing else. **This can be done for almost everything in your life**. Ditch whatever is keeping you from focusing on your habit.
- Make it easy/hard to get. Are you trying to reduce the amount of sodas you drink ? Add more water bottles in your fridle. Or keep a water bootle next to you. Prepare your sport bag the day before. Uninstall Instagram from your phone. Simply create more obstacle toward bad habits, and remove obstacles toward good habits.

### Make it satisfying

When you are young, you have a plethora of ways to see your progress. In fact, everything is measured. Your grades, your friends, your IQ [everything is a number.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RCvJoti-QY). Fortunately, we can use this again, to make sure you keep up with your healthy habits.

Your habits are just a mean to an end, but the true reward is the result of your habits. So, keep track of whatever you are trying to achieve.

If you want to lose weight by hitting the gym, write down everything you do at the gym, and keep track of your weight. It'll take a couple of weeks to notice some real results, but these will help you keep up with your habit.

Here is an example of [a simple tracker I did for my workouts](https://www.notion.so/Workouts-0f1b96b4d6264c1b9c4c782353485944?pvs=4), feel free to duplicate this page and use it for your own habits.

# Making he most out of your day

Now that we know how to create good habits, let's talk about how to make the most out of your day. A couple of years ago, I stumbled upon this [incredible article by Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html).

This simply explains that, when you consider a 24 hours day, and take out the time you need to sleep, you are left with roughly 100 blocks of 10 minutes.

Now the funny thing is, if you consider the 5 minutes rule we talked about earlier, you'll notice that most of the boring stuff can be done in a moatter of 3/4 blocks. Which leaves you with more than 95% of your day left!

## How to structure your day

According to the wonderful book [The One Thing](https://www.amazon.fr/One-Thing-Gary-Keller/dp/2379350477), by Gary Keller, we can get some insight on how to make the most out of the blocks we have left.

How do our habits fit into this ? Well, again, you can simply take a piece of paper, and draw a 10 by 10 grid on it. I'll be honest with you, this grid will only contain 100 blocks if you speel 7 hours and 20 minutes a day. I need a solid 8 hours of sleep, so I'll be using a 10 by 10 grid, and cross out the first two blocks. Now, let's keep in mind 3 essential rules:

- You want to add your good habits in this grid, including the ones you're already following, and the ones you want to create.
- Once you've added your habits, add the things you cannot remove (lunch, picking up the kids at school, apointments, etc.)
- Last but not least, add the tasks you have to do, starting with the big ones. The painful ones. Like [eating a frog](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog). It's always easier to start off with the dauting tasks, as your brain is still at peak capacity.
